This repository contains scripts which reproduce the results of <insert DOI here>, as well as links to a Zenodo repository <insert Zenodo link here> which holds EoS samples produced for the inference weighted by astrophysical observations.

For Equation of State samples, as well as weights which correspond to astrophysical observations, see the Zenodo Repository.  To perform an analogous simulation inference, see the `scripts`.
