This repository contains scripts which reproduce the results of  https://doi.org/10.1103/9kh9-xfpd, as well as links to a Zenodo repository https://zenodo.org/records/17352004 which holds EoS samples produced for the inference weighted by astrophysical observations.

For Equation of State samples, as well as weights which correspond to astrophysical observations, see the Zenodo Repository.  To perform an analogous simulation inference, see the `scripts`.
